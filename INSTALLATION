** INSTALLATION **


* GENERAL *


The first thing to do is to ensure you have git installed on your 
machine/device.
In a command-line shell, change to your desired project root directory and 
issue the command:

    git clone https://github.com/Paul-Tew/lifer.git

A new directory named 'lifer' will be created.


* LINUX INSTALLATION (and other *nix platforms) *

(This may work for Mac installations but I don't have the kind of money needed
to test it out for sure...)
Because this tool is pretty basic, the dependencies are minimal, ensure you
have the 'gcc' compiler and the relevant 'libc' development libraries installed,
that's all.

Start a command-line terminal and navigate to the **./lifer/src** directory.
Issue the command:

    gcc -Wall ./lifer.c ./liblife/liblife.c ./libbin2hex/libbin2hex.c -o lifer

Provided no warnings or errors appeared, you should now have an executable file
'lifer' sitting in the directory, you might want to check this by issuing the
command:

    ls -l

If all is OK then you can test that lifer works by testing it out on the file
specified in the Microsoft document which I included as part of the git
repository you cloned and should be sitting in the ./Test/ directory. You can
do this by issuing the command:

    ./lifer ./Test/Test1.lnk

You can also test that lifer works on a bunch of link files sitting in a
directory by issuing the command:

    ./lifer ./Test/WinXP/

Install the tool onto the OS by issuing the command:

    sudo install ./lifer /usr/bin/

This will enable you to use lifer anywhere on your system without specifying
the directory prefix.
(e.g. `lifer ./Test/Test.lnk` rather than `./lifer ./Test/Test.lnk`)


* WINDOWS INSTALLATION *


The lifer github project comes complete with a Visual Studio 2017 project
solution so the easiest way to create a Windows executable is to install Visual
Studio 2017 first. There is a free version (known as the 'community' version)
available at 
https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15

Once Visual Studio is installed:
* Left-click on **File->Open->Project/Solution** and browse to the
  **lifer.sln** file to load the solution into Visual Studio.
* On the Standard Toolbar, set the Solution Configuration options to those that
  suit your machine and preference (for example, I use: 'x64' and 'Debug')
* Build the solution from the 'Build' menu or simply use the key combination: 
  **Ctrl+Shift+B**
* Provided there were no errors you should have an executable 'lifer.exe' file
  in the relevant sub-folder of your project.
* At this point I usually open a Powershell terminal and navigate to the folder
  containing the executable which for me is done by issuing the command:

    cd "F:\\lifer\src\x64\Debug\"

* I then test the executable using the command:

    .\lifer.exe ..\..\Test\Test.lnk

It is possible to make lifer in Windows without installing Visual Studio but you
will still need to download and install the Visual C++ build tools available at
http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools

Once installed, lifer can be built in the ./src/ directory by issuing the command:

CL lifer.c .\liblife\liblife.c .\libbin2hex\libbin2hex.c .\Win\dirent.c .\Win\getopt.c
