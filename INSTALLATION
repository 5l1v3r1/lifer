INSTALLATION

LINUX
In a command terminal
  * Navigate to the ./src directory
  * Issue the following command:
  
    gcc ./lifer.c ./liblife/liblife.c -o lifer

Provided gcc and the development tools are installed on your system and no
errors were reported you should now have the tool 'lifer' sitting in your
src directory. You can test that it works by issuing the command:

    ./lifer ./Test/Test.lnk
	
The terminal should fill with data relating to the Microsoft shortcut example:

WINDOWS
The source code comes with a set of Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition 
solution files. If you don't have Visual Studio installed you can get the 
community edition from:
https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/
With this installed you should be able to navigate with the file explorer to
the 'src' folder and double-click on the 'lifer.vcxproj' file to open up the
solution in Visual Studio.
Check that the build target is suitable for your system (e.g. 'Debug' and 
'x64') and build the solution (Ctrl + Shift + B). Provided there were no errors
you should now have 'lifer.exe' in the associated build folder.

I have regularly come across the situation where an error occurs in the build
process and the linker fails to find the 'liblife' library functions 'get_lif'
and 'get_lif_a'. If this happens then right click on the liblife project in 
the solution explorer and choose properties. Ensure that the Configuration Type
is set to 'Static library (.lib)' and the Target Extension is set to '.lib'.
The solution should now build.
