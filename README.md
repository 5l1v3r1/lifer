'lifer' is a command-line tool inspired by the whitepaper 'The Meaning of Link
Files in Forensic Examinations' by Harry Parsonage and available from:
http://computerforensics.parsonage.co.uk/downloads/TheMeaningofLIFE.pdf

The tool uses a static library (liblife) which parses the file in accordance
with the Microsoft Open Specification Document 'MS-SHLLNK' which can be 
found online at:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd871305.aspx

The tool is designed to extract as much information as is available from a 
Windows shortcut file (or collection of such files). Output is to the terminal
screen but a simple redirection can create a text file or a comma/tab separated
file that can easily be imported into a spreadsheet.

Users are encouraged to read the whitepaper before assigning any meaning to 
results. No results should be ascribed to this tool without a FULL 
understanding of what the output represents; this particularly applies to
matters of fact for determination in a court of law. In such cases it is
encumbent on a user to understand the two documents fully as well as having a
full grasp on how Windows and other OS's treat the creation, moving, deletion
of such files. A working knowledge of how 'lifer' has interpreted and 
presented the data is also needed.
