IDLIST

What we know about IDList structures...

Feel free to contact Paul dot Tew at outlook dot com for me to acknowledge 
anyone else's (presumably awesome) work and incorporate your hacking (reverse
engineering) into this body of work...

ï For most link files there seems to be a common IDList[0] structure it is:
  unsigned AnsiChar data[20] = {
  0x14, 0x00, 0x1F, 0x50, 0xE0, 0x4F, 0xD0, 0x20, 0xEA, 0x3A, 0x69, 0x10, 0xA2,
  0xD8, 0x08, 0x00, 0x2B, 0x30, 0x30, 0x9D
  };
  Which in ANSII (en-gb) looks like:
  ' P‡O– Í:i ¢ÿ  +00 '
  The first two bytes are undoubtably a 16 bit integer representing the size of
  the initial IDList object but the next 18 are a mystery (some sort of unique
  IDList identifier?)

ï Some (older?) link files don't have this usual IDList[0] structure
